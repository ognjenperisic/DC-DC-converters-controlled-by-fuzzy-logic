# DC-DC-converters-fuzzy-logic

I've been listening (and watching) Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Machine Learning. Inspired by that, I found my undergrad thesis on Fuzzy Logic. It treats DC/DC voltage converters guided by fuzzy logic. The text is a bit long, and covers fuzzy logic essentials, and basic theory of controls systems guided by fuzzy logic. The DC/DC converter was interpreted through Matlab (Matlab toolbox) **. The text contains the description of voltage converter and the source code of the simulation program. It is in Serbian, of course.

To be honest, fuzzy logic is not exactly a machine learning protocol. It is more a decision theory, but it can be quite successful, as my thesis shows. 

The text is 100 pages long, but it can be browsed through easily.

**My Matlab/Octave skills improved noticeably since I wrote that simulation code :-)
